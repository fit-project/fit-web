# Manual Test Plan - fit-web

## Scope

This checklist is used for:
- release validation (for example `v1.0.0`)
- regression testing after changes
- manual validation of new features

## Test Environment

- Build type: local bundle or CI release package
- Network: internet connection available
- Test case available in FIT (valid case selected at startup)

## OS-specific Prerequisites

### macOS

**Installation / Setup**
1. Download the `.dmg` file from GitHub, or build it locally.
2. Open the `.dmg` file, then drag and drop `FitWeb.app` into the Applications folder.
3. Eject (unmount) and close the `.dmg`.

**Cleanup / Clean State**
1. Remove any existing `mitmproxy` certificate from system keychain/trust store.
2. Delete the `~/Library/Application Support/FIT` directory from the user profile.

### Windows

**Installation / Setup**
1. Use packaged installer/portable distribution for Windows.

**Cleanup / Clean State**
1. Remove any existing `mitmproxy` certificate from Windows certificate store.
2. Delete the `%LOCALAPPDATA%\\FIT` directory from the user profile.

### Linux

**Installation / Setup**
1. Use packaged installer/portable distribution for Linux.

**Cleanup / Clean State**
1. Remove any existing `mitmproxy` certificate from Linux trust store.
2. Delete the `~/.local/share/FIT` directory from the user profile.

## Common Functional Tests

### MTP-001 - MITMPROXY certificate installation flow

**Goal**
- Verify certificate installation error handling and successful bootstrap behavior.

**Steps**
1. Launch the app from the standard installation path for the current OS with clean state (certificate removed).
2. At the first MITMPROXY certificate prompt, click **Cancel**.
3. Re-launch the app and repeat certificate installation with an invalid password.
4. Re-launch the app, enter the correct admin password at the first prompt, then click **Cancel** on the second trust-related password prompt.
5. Re-launch the app and complete both password prompts with valid credentials.

**Expected result**
- Case 1 (**Cancel** at first prompt): an error popup is shown stating FIT cannot run without the certificate.
- Case 2 (invalid password): the initial MITMPROXY certificate installation popup is shown again.
- Case 3 (**Cancel** at second trust prompt): an error popup is shown again stating FIT cannot run without the certificate.
- Case 4 (successful installation): bootstrap completes and `Select a valid case` prompt is shown.

### MTP-002 - Root privileges prompt flow

**Goal**
- Verify root privileges prompt behavior and bootstrap blocking conditions.

**Steps**
1. Launch the app from the standard installation path for the current OS.
2. At the root privileges prompt, click **Cancel**.
3. Re-launch the app and enter an invalid password in the root privileges prompt.
4. Re-launch the app and enter the correct root password.

**Expected result**
- Case 1 (**Cancel**): an error popup is shown stating FIT cannot run without root privileges.
- Case 2 (invalid password): the initial root privileges popup is shown again.
- Case 3 (valid password): `Select a valid case` prompt is shown.

### MTP-003 - App startup and basic navigation

**Goal**
- Verify that the app starts correctly and web navigation works after bootstrap.

**Steps**
1. Launch the app from the standard installation path for the current OS.
2. Complete bootstrap requirements and select a valid case when prompted.
3. Verify that, at first home page load, an acquisition warning popup is shown (FIT may capture HTTP/HTTPS traffic generated by other open windows/apps and they should be closed if not relevant).
4. Close the warning popup.
5. Open a website from the URL bar (for example `https://example.com`).
6. Use `back`, `forward`, `reload`, and `home`.

**Expected result**
- App starts without crashes.
- Main window is visible and interactive.
- Acquisition warning popup is shown on home page load with network traffic capture warning.
- Navigation buttons work as expected.

### MTP-004 - Acquisition start/stop baseline flow

**Goal**
- Verify core acquisition flow and artifact generation.

**Steps**
1. Open a target website.
2. Click **Start acquisition**.
3. Browse at least 2-3 pages on the same domain.
4. Click **Stop acquisition**.
5. Wait for post-acquisition tasks to complete.
6. Open the generated acquisition folder.

**Expected result**
- Start/stop flow completes without blocking errors.
- Acquisition folder is created under the selected case.
- Expected baseline artifacts are present (including web capture outputs).

### MTP-005 - Verify timestamp and PEC dialogs load correctly

**Goal**
- Ensure bundled modules `fit-verify-pdf-timestamp` and `fit-verify-pec` load in the app.

**Steps**
1. Open fit-web.
2. Click **Verify timestamp**.
3. Close dialog.
4. Click **Verify PEC**.
5. Close dialog.

**Expected result**
- Both dialogs open correctly.
- No missing-resource errors (for example missing `lang/*.json`).
- No runtime crash when opening/closing dialogs.
